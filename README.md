# Web_scrapping_and_analysis
This is a full web-scraping and data analysis project. 
I've learned to identify HTML elements on a page, identify their id and class attributes, and use this knowledge to extract information via both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup. I've also learned to scrape various types of information. These include HTML tables and recurring elements, like multiple news articles on a webpage.
As woking on this Challenge,core skills like: collecting data, organizing and storing data, analyzing data, and then visually communicating insights are being practiced.
